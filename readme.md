# Array Snacks

## Description

**TuttiFrutti (array_lista)**

Description:
We have a refrigerator full of fruit:
'banana', 'apple', 'pear', 'cherry', 'orange', 'mandarin', 'watermelon', 'lemon', 'strawberry'
There is also a peach on the table, we put it in the fridge.
Tonight we have to make a watermelon cocktail: do we have it in the fridge or not?
Phases
1. create the array with the fruit from the refrigerator
2. add the peach to the fruit array
3. check if there is watermelon in the fruit array:
   - if there is, we print: "Found it! I just have to prepare the cocktail."
   - if I can't find it: "Oh no, I have to go out and buy watermelon!"

*Tips/Guidelines:*
*Yes, we know the includes() function exists but we don't want to use it to search the refrigerator.*

**The tail of the Array (array_tail)**


We create an array by asking the user how many elements it will contain and generating as many random numbers from 1 to 100 as there are elements to insert.
We then print the last 5 elements of the Array
**Bonuses:**
*We ask the user how many elements of the array we should print*

*Suggestions:*
*It is probably worth checking that the number of elements in the queue is not greater than the number of total elements in the array*

**Bonuses (array_bonus)**

Create two arrays that have different numbers of elements.
Add elements to the array that has the fewest elements until it has as many as the other.
